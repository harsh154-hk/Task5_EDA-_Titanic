# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights regarding passenger survival. The analysis was conducted using Python and various data visualization libraries.

## 🎯 Objective

To understand survival patterns among Titanic passengers and identify key factors influencing survival such as **gender**, **passenger class**, **age**, and **fare**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas**
* **Seaborn**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📊 Key Variables Analyzed

* `Sex`
* `Age`
* `Pclass`
* `Fare`
* `Survived`
* `SibSp`

## 🔍 Key Insights

* 👩‍🦰 **Females had a much higher survival rate** (93.8%) compared to males (10.1%).
* 🛏️ **1st class passengers** had the highest chances of survival.
* 👶 **Younger passengers** were more likely to survive.
* 💸 Passengers in **higher classes paid higher fares**.
* 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 `SibSp` (siblings/spouses aboard) had a **mild impact** on survival chances.

## ✅ Recommendations

* Enhance rescue measures for lower-class passengers.
* Ensure fair treatment in rescue efforts across **gender** and **class**.
* Explore outliers in **ticket pricing** and **survival** data.

## 💡 Modeling Tips

* Key predictive features: `Sex`, `Pclass`, `Fare`.
